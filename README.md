# Task 2: Backpropagation, Gradient descent and training <br/> CC6204 Deep Learning, Universidad de Chile  <br/>
## Name: Humberto Rodrigues

This project is a the second part of the Quickstart to Neural Networks using Pytorch the goal is the understanding of the most basic concepts and the creation of a first model using fixed parameters, however, the code built is general enough to support more complex models that the are being explored in this work.
